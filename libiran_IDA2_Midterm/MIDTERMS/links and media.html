 Formed in Japan in 2018, ZUTOMAYO (stylised in all caps; Japanese name ずっと真夜中でいいのに。 meaning “I wish it was midnight all the time”) emerged as a mysterious rock project whose full membership remains unpublished. 
The one constant face of the project is the vocalist‐songwriter known as ACAね (pronounced “Akane”). 
Their debut single, “秒針を噛む” (“Byōshin o Kamu”), dropped on YouTube in June 2018 and quickly gained traction.

 The group became noted for their genre-defying music—melding rock, jazz-fusion, alternative pop, and electronic touches—and for their unique visual approach: live shows often shrouded in darkness, screens, or other elements to conceal identity. 
Despite the anonymity, ZUTOMAYO achieved commercial success: their EPs charted highly on the Oricon charts soon after debut.

 The Reze Arc (also known as the Bomb Girl Arc) follows Denji’s brief encounter with love and betrayal, marking one of the most emotionally charged parts of Chainsaw Man’s first saga.
After the chaos of the Katana Man Arc, Denji begins to experience a more mundane life as a Public Safety Devil Hunter. One day, he meets Reze, a charming and kind girl who works at a local café. Reze’s warmth and playfulness immediately captivate Denji, and the two grow close through tender, almost normal moments—sharing laughter, swimming in the rain, and talking about freedom. For the first time, Denji begins to feel what genuine affection might be like.
However, Denji’s illusion of normalcy shatters when it’s revealed that Reze is actually the Bomb Devil hybrid, sent by the Soviet Union to steal Pochita’s heart. Despite her feelings for Denji appearing real, her mission forces her to turn against him. What follows is a brutal and visually spectacular series of battles, as Reze confronts Denji and other devil hunters in explosive combat.
In the end, after their fierce fight, Denji still can’t bring himself to hate her. He waits for her at their promised meeting spot—a café where she once invited him to run away together. Reze never arrives. Unbeknownst to Denji, she’s intercepted and killed by Makima, ensuring that his heart—and Pochita—remain under her control.

            <p>As Third Impact begins, a giant Rei-Lilith figure rises into the sky, glowing with divine light. Around the world, people look up and see Rei’s face appearing before them. One by one, their bodies dissolve into orange LCL fluid as their AT Fields collapse. Each person’s form melts away, leaving behind only crosses of light. Their souls drift upward and merge into the vast sea of consciousness — the moment humanity loses its individuality and becomes one.</p>
